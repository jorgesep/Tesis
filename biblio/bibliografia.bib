There is no standardised methodology for subjective evaluations of segmentation performance and these are currently perceived as too onerous. Using an experimental design and data analysis method derived from current practice in experimental psychology, we have explored a performance evaluation procedure that is largely based on subjective assessments. We report on statistically significant differences in perceived performance between three multi-object video segmentation and tracking methods developed for surveillance applications. The assessments were performed by a group each of experts and novices on a wide range of video content.},

To address this issue, we first identify the main challenges of background subtraction in the field of video surveillance. We then compare the performance of nine background subtraction methods with post-processing according to their ability to meet those challenges. Therefore, we introduce a new evaluation data set with accurate ground truth annotations and shadow masks. This enables us to provide precise in-depth evaluation of the strengths and drawbacks of background subtraction methods.},

The aim of this paper is firstly to provide an extended and updated survey of the recent researches and patents which concern statistical background modeling and secondly to achieve a comparative evaluation. For this, we firstly classified the statistical methods in term of category. Then, the original methods are reminded and discussed following the challenges met in video sequences. We classified their respective improvements in term of strategies used. Furthermore, we discussed them in term of the critical situations they claim to handle. Finally, we conclude with several promising directions for future research. The survey also discussed relevant patents.},

    abstract = {{Mixture of Gaussians is a widely used approach for background modeling to detect moving objects from static cameras. Numerous improvements of the original method developed by Stauffer and Grimson [1] have been proposed over the recent years and the purpose of this paper is to provide a survey and an original classification of these improvements. We also discuss relevant issues to reduce the computation time. Firstly, the original MOG are reminded and discussed following the challenges met in video sequences. Then, we categorize the different improvements found in the literature. We have classified them in term of strategies used to improve the original MOG and we have discussed them in term of the critical situations they claim to handle. After analyzing the strategies and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research.}},
