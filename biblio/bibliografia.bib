There is no standardised methodology for subjective evaluations of segmentation performance and these are currently perceived as too onerous. Using an experimental design and data analysis method derived from current practice in experimental psychology, we have explored a performance evaluation procedure that is largely based on subjective assessments. We report on statistically significant differences in perceived performance between three multi-object video segmentation and tracking methods developed for surveillance applications. The assessments were performed by a group each of experts and novices on a wide range of video content.},

To address this issue, we first identify the main challenges of background subtraction in the field of video surveillance. We then compare the performance of nine background subtraction methods with post-processing according to their ability to meet those challenges. Therefore, we introduce a new evaluation data set with accurate ground truth annotations and shadow masks. This enables us to provide precise in-depth evaluation of the strengths and drawbacks of background subtraction methods.},
